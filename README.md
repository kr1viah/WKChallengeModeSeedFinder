# WKChallengeModeSeedFinderLookupTableGPU
The same as my GPU implementation, but this'll make sure that a seed with any given parameters does or does not exist.

Note that you'll need something like tdm-gcc and add it to path in order to compile the program. Until I find a good way to upload `table.bin` (32gb file) and share it here I've included tableFiller.go, which I ran on a Google Cloud VM, and then downloaded on to my machine.
